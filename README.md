# aapanel-updater

This project is made with 2 submodules: `aapanel` and `aapanel-preinstalled` (they are the two project folders). They work separately.

The `aapanel` folder contains a clean install for aapanel with watchtower. The `aapanel-preinstalled` is a structure to your own aapanel image after install the apps.

The main `docker-compose.yml` file works with swarm mode and keeps centos 7 up to date. This help fix to slow start container.
